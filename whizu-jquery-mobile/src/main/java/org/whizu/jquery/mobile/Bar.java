/**
 * If you need to create a header that doesn't follow the default configuration,
 * simply wrap your custom styled markup in any container, such as div. The plugin
 * won't apply the automatic button logic to the wrapped content inside the header
 * container so you can write custom styles for laying out the content in your
 * header. It's also possible to create custom bars without using the header
 * data-role at all. For example, start with any container and add the ui-bar class
 * to apply standard bar padding and add the ui-bar-b class to assign the bar
 * swatch styles from your theme. (The "b" can be any swatch letter.)
